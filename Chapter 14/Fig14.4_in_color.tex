\caption{Schematic of the $g-2$ muon storage ring experiment. High-energy protons hit a target,
producing secondary pions. These latter shortly decay into muons (and neutrinos). The muons are
polarized. The arrows symbolize the
muon spin direction. Muons of a given momentum are trapped in the storage ring until they decay. The
decay electron is analyzed to determine the muon polarization. At every turn, the angle between the momentum
and the spin of the muon increases due to the anomalous $g-2$ term, as schematically illustrated.}
