## Abstract

Written for a two-semester Master's or graduate course, this comprehensive treatise intertwines theory and experiment in an original approach that covers all aspects of modern particle physics. The author uses rigorous step-by-step derivations and provides more than 100 end-of-chapter problems for additional practice to ensure that students will not only understand the material but also be able to apply their knowledge. Featuring up-to-date experimental material, including the discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN and of neutrino oscillations, this monumental volume also serves as a one-stop reference for particle physics researchers of all levels and specialties. Richly illustrated with more than 450 figures, the text guides students through all the intricacies of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in an intuitive manner that few books achieve.

## Reviews & Endorsements

‘This is the text I wish I had when studying advanced particle physics! Comprehensive and pedagogical, it can be adapted to most courses on the subject by selecting the relevant material. Rubbia’s book will in my opinion become a valuable reference for the scientific libraries of instructors, students, and researchers.’ Alessandro Cerri, University of Sussex

‘This book is an ideal and complete particle physics textbook for Ph.D. students and postdocs. I have not seen any other textbook as comprehensive as this one. It addresses both the phenomenology of particle physics and quantum field theory, along with the history and experiments. It will show you how wonderful and exciting particle physics can be.’ Nakaya Tsuyoshi, Kyoto University

‘This textbook is excellent because it comprehensively summarizes the phenomenology and experiments of particle physics, including the latest results. When I was young, I wanted to come across a book like this.’ Takaaki Kajita, University of Tokyo
